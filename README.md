* I like to build things, I was going into engineering but there was too much math for my liking in that degree so I switched to CS because its the same, just building things on a computer.

* Ive been really into Disc Golf latley, my brother in law used to be the captin of the ultimate frisbee team here at GV and he got me into it. now I play at least twice every week with an old roommate and friends.

* I find generational algorithms very interesting and I know you have done some things with those because I think you came to the computing club and presented some of your reserch one time I was there.

## Technical Background

I am a Junior at Grand Valley and im set to graduate in the winter of 2024.
I have taken classes to learn HTML5, CSS, SQL, and C# at a smaller college 
named Northwestern Michigan College which is located in Traverse City Michigan.
After doing two years there I transfered to Grand valley and have taken 
classes to learn Java, SQL, C, and Ive taught myself python because GV 
is switching to python and every class I take now expects me to know python 
like I was taught it, but I also learned it because its useful to know.
